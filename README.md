# Smart rockets
A simple project to demostrate genetic algorithms.


## Usage
There are some interactions in a simulation that can be made.

* `q` . quit
* `a` - increase the speed of the simulation
* `z` - decrease the speed of the simulation
* `r` - restars the simulation and reloads the config from file
* Right mouse button - change the position of the target

## Config
Some parameters can be changed in the simulation with ease. Edit the config.json file with the new values and reload the simulation with the `r` key. The parameter win\_size is an exception and cannot be reloaded during runtime.
